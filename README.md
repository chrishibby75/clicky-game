# Dog Clicky Game

## Overview
The Dog Clicky Game is a game that tests your memory to see how many times you can click on a different dog.  If you click on a dog more than once, the score starts over at 0.

## Details
This game was built using React.js.  I created a React client-side boiler plate by typing "create-react-app app-name" in the command line.  Then I added a src file that holds the components along with the index.js and app.js files.  I used four components.  The board, header, footer and transition components.
